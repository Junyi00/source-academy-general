[This link](https://source-academy.github.io/) provides access to the public version of the Source Academy, which is deployed using GitHub Pages.

## Language selection

The Source languages are sublanguages of JavaScript, designed for the chapters of SICP JS. The  language Source ยง1 has just enough features for the content of Chapter 1 of SICP JS, Source ยง2 has jsut enough features for the first two chapters, and so on.
