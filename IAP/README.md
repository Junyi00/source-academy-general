# A Taste of Programming with SICP JS, IAP @ MIT, January 18-28, 2022

## Description

We can understand some computer programs in the way we solve math equations: by performing one simple algebraic step after another, until we reach an answer. This Independent Activity introduces programming in this way, inspired by the first chapter of [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, JavaScript edition](https://sourceacademy.org/sicpjs/) (SICP JS). We start from first principles, by looking at functions that you know from mathematics, but before long, you will program interesting graphics and sound patterns using the Source Academy, a website built for SICP JS. The Activity offers entertaining and thought-provoking insights into the essence of computation, and at the same time an introduction to programming using the popular programming language JavaScript.

You can attend one to six days, depending on your preference. Each day has a lecture, a Reflection session, and an optional Studio session.

## Prerequisites

No prerequisite knowledge. No programming experience is needed. People who already have programmed are likely to get a new perspective on what programming can be. You will use your own computing device: laptop or large tablet with an internet browser (Chrome, Firefox, or MS Edge). Internet connectivity is required.

## Each day

Each day will start with a lecture of approximately 1 hour and 45 minutes (online or in person, to be decided). There will be an online Reflection session of 1 to 1 1/2 hours starting at 4pm that will include group discussion, individual programming exercises, and guided pair programming. For extra fun, an experienced assistant will facilitate optional 2-hour online Studio sessions in small groups each evening from 8pm to 10pm.
