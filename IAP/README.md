# A Taste of Programming with SICP JS, IAP @ MIT, 2022

## Description

We can understand some computer programs in the way we solve math equations: by performing one simple algebraic step after another, until we reach an answer. This Independent Activity introduces programming in this way, inspired by the first chapter of Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, JavaScript edition (SICP JS). We start from first principles, by looking at functions that you know from mathematics, but before long, you will program interesting graphics and sound patterns using the Source Academy, a website built for SICP JS. The Activity offers entertaining and thought-provoking insights into the essence of computation, and at the same time a gentle introduction to programming using the popular programming language JavaScript.

The Independent Activity covers six days with afternoon lectures, group discussions, individual programming exercises, and guided pair programming work, and with online group small-group sessions in the evening.

## Prerequisites

No prerequisite knowledge. No programming experience is needed. People who already have programmed are likely to get a new perspective on what programming can be. Students are expected to bring their own computing device: laptop or large tablet, required software: internet browser (Chrome, Firefox, MS Edge, or Safari). Internet connectivity is required.

## Each day

Each day will start with a lecture of approximately 1 hour and 45 minutes (online or offline, in the morning or early afternoon, to be decided). There will be a practical Reflection session of 1 to 1 1/2 hours starting at 4pm that will include pair work, and a 2-hour online Studio session in small groups in the evening from 8pm to 10pm.
