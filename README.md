# Source Academy

The Source Academy is a community of learners who use the book [*Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, JavaScript Adaptation*](https://sourceacademy.org/sicpjs/) (SICP JS). The community is developing and maintaining the eponymous [Source Academy](https://sourceacademy.org/), an immersive online experiential environment for learning programming. Here you find resources for learners and instructors who use SICP JS (with or without the Source Academy system), and for Source Academy system administrators. (Developers refer to the wikis and READMEs of the specific repositories in this organization.)
