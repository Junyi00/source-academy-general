The Source Academy is a community of learners who use the book [*Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, JavaScript Adaptation*](https://sourceacademy.org/sicpjs/) (SICP JS). The community is developing and maintaining the [Source Academy](https://sourceacademy.org/) system, an immersive online experiential environment for learning programming. Here you find resources for [learners](https://about.sourceacademy.org/learner/README.html) and [educators](https://about.sourceacademy.org/educator/README.html) who use SICP JS, and for educational [researchers](https://about.sourceacademy.org/research/README.html). <!-- use full URLs for these three references here -->

Our mission is to *bring out the beauty and fun in programming and the ideas behind programming, and make these ideas universally accessible*.
