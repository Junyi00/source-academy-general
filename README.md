# Source Academy

The Source Academy is a community of learners who use the book [*Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, JavaScript Adaptation*](https://sourceacademy.org/sicpjs/) (SICP JS). The community is developing and maintaining the [Source Academy](https://sourceacademy.org/) system, an immersive online experiential environment for learning programming. Here you find resources for learners and educators who use SICP JS (with or without the Source Academy system), and for educational researchers.
