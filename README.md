The Source Academy is a community of learners who use the book [*Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, JavaScript Adaptation*](https://sourceacademy.org/sicpjs/) (SICP JS). The community is developing and maintaining the [Source Academy](https://sourceacademy.org/) system, an immersive online experiential environment for learning programming. Here you find resources for [learners](/learner) and educators who use SICP JS, and for educational researchers.

Our mission is to *bring out the beauty and fun in programming and the ideas behind programming, and make these ideas universally accessible*.
