# Source Academy Notification


## About

Source Academy has introduced notifications for educators, avengers and students; and they are configurable to customise to your needs.

Currently, notifications are sent through **email**, however we intend to expand to other mediums as well. Furthermore, we will increase the number of notifications available to make the experience on Source Academy more enjoyable!

## How It Works

The types of notifications have already been determined and as an educator, you can view and configure these notifications for avengers and students in the course. 

The students or avengers will then be able to make preferences based on the options you provide. If they do not do so, the default option that you choose will be used.

## Getting Started

Once logged into Source Academy, the notifications administrative panel can be found in settings.

The table displays a series of notifications available for your course, the following are some information found in the table.

| Column | Purpose | 
| :-:    | :-      |
| Notification Type   | The name of the notification |
| Assessment Type | The name of the assessment category the notification applies to |
| Recipients | Who the notification is sent to | 

The following table describes the possible configurations and its respective meaning.

| Configuration | Purpose | Note |
| :-:           | :-      | :-   |
| Enabled    | Enabling/Disabling the notification for the whole course    | Disabling this **overrides** the avenger/students' decision to turn off/on the notification     |  
| Reminder Time Options  | Decide the notification periods for the notification to be sent out   | 
| Default Reminder | Default reminder choice if student/avenger does not indicate a preference | 

**Note**: Not all notification's time options can be configured. Notifications that are sent out on user actions are done so immediately.

## Example

`Asseessment Deadline` is one of the configurable notifications for students when their assessment is close to the deadline. As an educator, you can select if you want to have this notification enabled and **how long before** the assessment expires when the notifications should be sent.
