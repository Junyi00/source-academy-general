# Resources for learners

The learners in the Source Academy community might find the following resources useful.

- [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, JavaScript Edition (SICP JS)](https://sourceacademy.org/sicpjs): online edition of the textbook (see also the [textbook github repository](https://github.com/source-academy/sicp), for reporting errors and for typesetting our own copy)
- [Source](https://docs.sourceacademy.org): Source languages used in the book (sublanguages of JavaScript)
- [Email to sourceacademy@nus.edu.sg](mailto:sourceacademy@comp.nus.edu.sg?subject=Source%20Academy%20Course%20Inquiry) if you are looking to join a Source Academy course (subject: Source Academy Course Inquiry, mention desired time frame and your background)

Currently, learners have the following options. If you take a course based on SICP JS, check with your instructor which option applies to the course:

- [Learn with SICP JS without Source Academy](../package/README.md) 
- [Learn with Source Academy](../vanilla/README.md) without GitHub Classroom
- [Learn with Source Academy and GitHub Classroom](github/README.md) 
- [Learn with Source Academy @ NUS](nus/README.md)
