# Source Academy @ NUS

The public [Source Academy site](https://sourceacademy.org) lets you connect to Google Drive and Github to store your programs.

[Source Academy @ NUS](https://sourceacademy.nus.edu.sg) is an extension that allows educators to set up and manage a course and enrol learners and staff. Staff can set up *Assessments*, learners can submit assessments, and staff can grade assessments manually or set up automated grading using test cases. Source Academy @ NUS also comes with an *Achievements* system that gives learners continuous feedback on their performance in Assessments. Educators can set up a graphic-novel style game that provides the context for themed Assessments and release Chapters of the game as the course unfolds.
