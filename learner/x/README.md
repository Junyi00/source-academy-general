# Source Academy @ X

The public [Source Academy site](https://sourceacademy.org) lets learners connect to Google Drive and Github to store your programs.

[Source Academy @ NUS](https://sourceacademy.nus.edu.sg)  is an extension of the public [Source Academy site](https://sourceacademy.org)  that allows educators to set up and manage a course and enrol learners and staff. Staff can set up *Assessments*, learners can submit assessments, and staff can grade assessments manually or set up automated grading using test cases. Source Academy @ NUS also features *Achievements* that give learners continuous feedback on their performance in Assessments. Educators can set up a graphic-novel style game that provides the context for themed Assessments and release Chapters of the game as their course unfolds.

Educators can consult [Resources for educators](../../educator/README.md) for details on how to set up a course in Source Academy @ X.
