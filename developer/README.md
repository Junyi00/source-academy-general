common IDE features.

pages using HTML5.

- Improvements of tools: Stepper, environment visualizer, achievements, robotics.
- Improvements and extensions of existing modules: video, sound, graphics processing.
- Improvements of language implementations: Accessing the browsers' native JavaScript
execution for performance-critical applications.
